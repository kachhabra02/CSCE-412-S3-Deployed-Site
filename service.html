                        Throughout elementary, middle, and high school, I spent quite a few weekends volunteering at the <a href="https://www.houstonfoodbank.org/">Houston Food Bank</a>. During this time, 
                        I mostly helped out in packing and distributing meals to underprivileged individuals in the Houston Metropolitan area.

                        <br>

                        I believe that giving back to those less fortunate than I am is important and integral to a well-rounded and fulfilling life. 
                        This organization is one of the major ways that I have worked towards this goal of helping others that are in need.

                <p class="nature-p">
                    In high school, I enjoyed volunteering at the <a href="https://houstonaudubon.org/sanctuaries/edith-moore/visitor.html">Houston Audubon Edith Moore Nature Sanctuary</a>. 
                    The sanctuary is a nice area of greenery, which is a welcome change of pace from the concrete jungle of Houston.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Usual responsibilities included cleaning up trash around the sanctuary and planting new samplings, but after Hurricane Harvey there were added 
                    responsibilities of repairing woodwork and replacing eroded soil. Overall, I found my volunteering visits to the sanctuary to be both relaxing and enriching.

                I have not volunteered with <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/">Teach for America</a>, but I have greatly enjoyed teaching and a TA and 
                would like to further explore teaching while making a positive impact in underserved communities.
